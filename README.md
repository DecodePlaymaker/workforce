## Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   git clone git@github.com:DecodePlaymaker/workforce.git

2. Open in VS Code. If you do not have VS code you must install it.

3. Using the terminal, install node.js v16. If you have homebrew, the command should look like the following (brew install node@16), however this may vary and the documentation should be consulted.

4. Once node.js v16 is installed, in the terminal, utilize the command npm init -y to initialize and create a package where project files will be stored.

5. Next, use the terminal to run the command npm i inquirer@8.2.4 to install v8.2.4 of the inquirer.

6. To run the application, within the terminal, type the command node index.js.
